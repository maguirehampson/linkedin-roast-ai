   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Publish Directory**
   ```
   .next
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Add the same environment variables as above

## üîß Post-Deployment Verification

### Test These Features:

1. **File Upload**
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Verify it's stored in `/uploads/` directory

2. **PDF Text Extraction**
   - Upload a LinkedIn profile PDF
   - Check that text is extracted properly

3. **AI Roast Generation**
   - Submit a roast request
   - Verify OpenAI API is working
   - Check that results are stored in `/data/roasts.json`

4. **Email Capture**
   - Submit an email
   - Verify it's stored in `/data/emails.json`

5. **File Serving**
   - Access uploaded files via `/api/uploads/[filename]`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Ensure variables are set in your deployment platform
   - Check that variable names match exactly
   - Restart the deployment after adding variables

2. **File Upload Fails**
   - Check that `/uploads/` directory exists
   - Verify file size limits (10MB)
   - Check file type validation

3. **PDF Text Extraction Fails**
   - Ensure `pdf-parse` is properly installed
   - Check that PDF files are valid
   - Verify file permissions

4. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check API usage limits
   - Ensure model name is correct

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check if build works locally
npm run build

# Test development server
npm run dev

# Check environment variables
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify file structure
ls -la uploads/
ls -la data/
```

## üìä Monitoring

### What to Monitor:

1. **API Response Times**
   - File upload speed
   - PDF extraction time
   - OpenAI API response time

2. **Error Rates**
   - File upload failures
   - PDF extraction errors
   - OpenAI API errors

3. **Storage Usage**
   - Upload directory size
   - Database file sizes

4. **User Engagement**
   - Number of roasts generated
   - Email capture rate
   - Social shares

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current MVP Security:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are server-side only
- ‚úÖ File uploads are validated
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in client code
- ‚úÖ Uploaded files are gitignored

### For Production:
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Use cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary)
- [ ] Add proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add input sanitization

## üöÄ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the full user flow**
2. **Monitor for errors**
3. **Gather user feedback**
4. **Plan production improvements**
